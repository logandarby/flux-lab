# Fluid Simulation

- Maybe not just smoke, but water, fire, air, earth
    - or maybe split up into four quadrants w/ different intstruments
    - start w/ one instrument -- arp would be easy

- midi keyboard interface to change fundamental note

- some meme shit-- press space and some thunderbolt shit makes a loud noise

- Fonts I like: anova, nevalisa, aqreamig (lowercase)

- magic sketchpad inspo

## Tech Details

- All goes off of some keyboard root fundamental to create an arp

- w/ smoke simulation
- each portion of grid represents some note (low - high is down - up)
    - left to right is some timbral modulation
- velocity & density can go to volume & reverb
    - higher density = louder volume
    - lower velocity = more reverb
- ONLY applies to notes in its vicinity -- some smoothing algorithm
- maybe everything is sustained normally by default
    - vorticity around notes creates an ARP effect
