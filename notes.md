# Fluid Simulation

## Inspo

- L-Drones https://codepen.io/teropa/full/opjrBE
    - kind of similar to my idea
- Magic sketchpad 
    - Inspired feeling
- WebGL fluid simulation https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/
    - for smoke simulation
- Some cool AV stuff from an artist
    - https://ctpt.co/
- Google experiments have some cool things
    - Patatap is a great artistic experiement
    - Enough is a beautiful interactive audiobook
- Tero. Some cool experiments https://teropa.info/

## Fluid Simulation 

- For better poisson eq solvers, see Bolz et al. 2003, Goodnight et al. 2003, and Kr√ºger and Westermann 2003.

## Notes

- Maybe not just smoke, but water, fire, air, earth
    - or maybe split up into four quadrants w/ different intstruments
    - start w/ one instrument -- arp would be easy

- midi keyboard interface to change fundamental note

- some meme shit-- press space and some thunderbolt shit makes a loud noise

- Fonts I like: anova, nevalisa, aqreamig (lowercase)

- magic sketchpad inspo

## Tech Details

- All goes off of some keyboard root fundamental to create an arp

- w/ smoke simulation
- each portion of grid represents some note (low - high is down - up)
    - left to right is some timbral modulation
- velocity & density can go to volume & reverb
    - higher density = louder volume
    - lower velocity = more reverb
- ONLY applies to notes in its vicinity -- some smoothing algorithm
- maybe everything is sustained normally by default
    - vorticity around notes creates an ARP effect

### Possible technology to get audio

- tidal/strudel
    - live coding
- tone.js
